Sometimes, you want to restrict which items are returned by a query. For example,
you only want the items written before 2024, that have "manifesto" in the title,
or that were authored by the "John von Neumann."

## What is a "wishlist"
Metadata filters are easy if the data that you're working with
is very homogenous. Sadly, few real-world datasets are.

The `wishlist` is a way to specify metadata filters
that get applied on a best-effort basis. For example, if you want
documents authored by John von Neumann. You can just set the `author` filter
to "John von Neumann". Amazingly, this will work even if no
items have the `author` field, but instead have a `creator`,
`created_by`, `authored_by`, or `author_` fields. We match
them at query time.

**This doesn't just make it easier for humans to write metadata
filters, it gets easier for LLMs too.**
This is really important. You can let an LLM hallucinate
any parameters it wants, and we match it to metadata
that actually exists. No knowledge about the data is required.

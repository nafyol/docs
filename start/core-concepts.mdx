## Capsules
Capsules are where data is stored – think of it like a mixture between a database and an S3 bucket.
Each one is assigned a unique ID like `irrotational-airfoil-b2a3` and is hosted at: `https://irrotational-airfoil-b2a3.sid.ai`.
Data can be added through the dashboard or programmatically with the API.

## Queries
A query is the primary way to acces information in a capsule. 
They are designed to be easy for *LLMs to write*. 
Every query has three parts:
- `query`: natural language query, like "What is the capital of France?"
- `wishlist`: desired metadata filters – they can be completely free-form and don't need to exist in the data
- `limit`: the maximum number of results to return

## API keys
API keys are used to authenticate requests to the API. You can create an API key in the [dashboard](https://dashboard.sid.ai).

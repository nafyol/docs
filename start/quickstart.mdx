SID breaks down into two atomic units:
 - **Capsule**: a collection of data
 - **Query**: a way to access that data

## Your first query
We're going to create our first capsule later.
First, let's query a capsule that already exists.
Here's one that contains all of Wikipedia:

<CodeGroup>
```bash curl
curl -X POST 'https://slow-winds-a1b2.sid.ai/v1/query' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--body '{"query": "Who was John von Neumann?", "wishlist": {}, "limit": 3}' \
```
</CodeGroup>
Pretty neat! The response should look something like this:
```json
{}
```
If you want to learn more about how a query works and what all the parameters mean – like `wishlist` and `limit`,

<Note>`slow-winds-a1b2` is a public capsule, so no API key is required. If you want to query a private capsule, you'll need to create an API key in the dashboard.</Note>

## Your first capsule
The easiest way to create a capsule is using the dashboard. 
Please remember the ID of the capsule you created – you can always look it up in the dashboard.
It will look something like this: `irrotational-airfoil-b2a3`.
<Steps>
<Step title="Open the dashboard">
Go to the [dashboard](https://dashboard.sid.ai).
</Step>
<Step title="Create a new capsule">
Navigate to the "Home" tab and click on the "Create a new capsule" button. Remember the unique ID of the capsule you created.
</Step>
<Step title="Add data">
Add some data to the capsule – like a file.
</Step>
<Step title="Create an API key" icon="circle-exclamation">
Navigate to the "API keys" tab and click on the "Create an API key" button.
</Step>
</Steps>

title: 'Getting Credentials'
description: 'Obtain the necessary secrets to set up the authorization flow'
---
To initiate the [authorization flow](/auth/flow) you need to identify your application to the API. 
This is done by providing a client ID and a client secret. 

## Obtaining Credentials
You can use the SID [developer dashboard](https://app.sid.ai) to create a new application and obtain credentials.
You will need to provide a name for your application, and a list of redirect URIs (explained below).

### Redirect URIs
A redirect URI is a URL that SID will redirect the user to after they have authorized your application.
You can choose any URL you like, such as `https://example.com/api/sid/callback`.
Because the redirect contains sensitive data, the set of all valid redirect URIs must be pre-registered with SID.

Usually, you will have a redirect URI for each environment that your application runs in (e.g. local development, staging, production).

For example, you may have the following set of redirect URIs:
- `https://localhost:3000/api/sid/callback`
- `https://staging.example.com/api/sid/callback`
- `https://example.com/api/sid/callback`

Alternatively, you can create separate applications (with separate credentials) for each environment.

### Credentials
After you have created your application, you will be given a client ID and a client secret.
You will need to store these securely, as they are used to identify your application to the API.

## Conventions
Throughout these docs, we assume that your credentials are stored in the following environment variables:
| Enviroment Variable | Value | Is Secret? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SID_CLIENT_ID`       | Client ID| No |
| `SID_CLIENT_SECRET`   | Client Secret | Yes |
| `SID_REDIRECT_URI`    | The redirect URI corresponding to the current environment | No |

<Info>
Choose the appropriate redirect URI based on your environment. If you are developing locally,
you will most likely need to use a `localhost` URI.

<Info>
In a localhost environment, the port is a fixed component of the redirect URI. 
If you wish to use different ports, you will need to add a separate redirect URI for each port.

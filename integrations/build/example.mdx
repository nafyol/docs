description: 'Give your users personalized ideas for using your application'

An important part of building a great experience is educating your users on what is possible with your application.
For example, if you are building a chat application powered by SID (e.g. our [demo](https://demo.sid.ai)),
you might want to show your users what kinds of questions they can ask.

The purpose of the [example endpoint](/api-reference/example) is exactly this.
It allows you to generate personalized example content to show to your users.
The generated examples are based on the data that your users have in their connected sources,
which means that the [query endpoint](/api-reference/query) will be able to provide context to answer them.

## An Example
The endpoint is very simple to use, and takes only a single parameter: `type`.
This parameter specifies the type of example that you want to generate.
The possible values are `question`, which generates a question that can be answered by your application,
and `task`, which generates a task that could be performed by an AI agent.

```json
{
    "type": "question"
}
```

The response will contain the generated example. 
In the future, it will also contain additional metadata about the generated example.

```json
{
    "result": {
        "text": "What does SID.ai do?"
    }
}
```

Further details are available in the [API reference](/api-reference/example).

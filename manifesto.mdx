I'm sitting here, writing. Just turned on my favorite set. Vim open; my favorite aircraft on another screen. 
It's time to change the world.


San Francisco is a weird place. Every interaction starts with "what do you do?" A question banned in France.
Every answer is assessed and ranked. "Would I want to work on this? Should I be working on this?"
The only upside is you get *really* good at telling people what you do. In theory.

So what do I do? I'm trying to make the world use data better. I think it's the noblest thing in the world.

### What do I mean by "data" and what do I mean by "use better"?

Compounding information is the only thing that sets us apart from humans 10,000 years ago.
Biologically, humans changed little, but every new generation learned just a little from the last.
This learning used to be lossy – only transmitted by spoken language. 
Progress was slow.
Then came papyrus, books, the internet, and now AI.
Today, everything is logged, stored, and warehoused.

Our ability to produce data now outstrips our ability to consume it.
We've entered a new paradigm:
> Data, data everywhere but not a drop of information.
Producers of data are no longer just educated priests. Everyone produces. 
And not only humans produce: Every sensor, every computer, and now ever LLM is churning out data.
Wikipedia took humanity millions of hours to create. 
OpenAI servers produce a Wikipedia every 100 seconds.

Yet, the sciences seem stuck. Progress feels slowing, not <Tooltip tip="There is a nonzero chance that this is just the incorrect impression of an ape sitting on an exponential.">quickening.</Tooltip>
